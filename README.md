# SNAKE-GAME

This was my childhood game and I wanted to code this game with JavaScript. Simple but working well. Just the arrow keys, the snake can pass through the walls. I could put "points to collect". Maybe someone who is interested can do that. There is no collision detection (no win/loss)
Also, pressing two directions in quick succession allows the snake to reverse direction on itself. (This is an issue with the FPS limiting vs. event-driven key handling.)
Food can spawn on top of the snake.
